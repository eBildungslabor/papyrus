# Papyrus
Small, static-site for hosting read-optimized content, like stories or e-books

## Optimized for readability
Papyrus was originally designed and built to host an e-book novel. As such, the static site template is optimized from color and user interfaces to typefaces to be comfortable for reading on screens. Line-heights and character sizes are adjusted at various screen sizes for comfort, and the navigation arrows and the table of contents allow for easy navigation around the site, as if it were a book.


## Responsive and Lightweight
While being well-designed and easy to read, the template is also lightweight and fully responsive to boot, still leaving room for customizations through CSS stylings and custom scripts.
